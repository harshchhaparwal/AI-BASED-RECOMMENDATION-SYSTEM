##DESCRIPTION:
Overview: 
This project implements a Recommendation System using Apache Mahout in Java to suggest products or content based on user preferences. The system applies collaborative filtering, where recommendations are generated by analyzing past user interactions. It is designed for applications like e-commerce, movie streaming, and personalized content recommendations.

Key Features:
✅ Collaborative Filtering – Uses user-item interaction data for predictions.
✅ Apache Mahout Integration – Utilizes machine learning algorithms for recommendations.
✅ User Similarity Calculation – Determines recommendations based on similar users.
✅ Scalability – Can handle large datasets efficiently.

How It Works
1. Data Collection – The system reads a dataset (data.csv) containing user ratings for items.
2. Similarity Calculation – Uses Pearson Correlation to find users with similar preferences.
3. Recommendation Generation – Suggests new items to a user based on what similar users liked.
4. Result Display – Shows recommended items with predicted scores.

Technologies Used
1. Java (Core Java for implementation)
2. Apache Mahout (Machine Learning library)
3. CSV Data Handling (User-item interactions stored in data.csv)
